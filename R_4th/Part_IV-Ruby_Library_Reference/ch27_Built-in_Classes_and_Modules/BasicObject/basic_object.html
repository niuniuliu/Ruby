<h1>Class BasicObject</h1>

  BasicObject is the parent class of all classes in Ruby. It's an explicit blank class.

  BasicObject can be used for creating object hierarchies independent of Ruby's
object hierarchy, proxy objects like the Delegator class, or other uses where
namespace pollution from Ruby's methods and classes must be avoided.

  To avoid polluting BasicObject for other users an appropriately named
subclass of BasicObject should be created instead of directly modifying
BasicObject:

class MyObjectSystem < BasicObject
end

  BasicObject does not include Kernel (for methods like puts) and BasicObject is
outside of the namespace of the standard library so common classes will not
be found without a using a full class path.

  A variety of strategies can be used to provide useful portions of the standard
library to subclasses of BasicObject. A subclass could include Kernel to
obtain puts, exit, etc. A custom Kernel-like module could be created and
included or delegation can be used via method_missing:

class MyObjectSystem < BasicObject
  DELEGATE = [:puts, :p]

  def method_missing(name, *args, &block)
    super unless DELEGATE.include? name
    ::Kernel.send(name, *args, &block)
  end

  def respond_to_missing?(name, include_private = false)
    DELEGATE.include?(name) or super
  end
end

  Access to classes and modules from the Ruby standard library can be
obtained in a BasicObject subclass by referencing the desired constant from
the root like ::File or ::Enumerator. Like method_missing, const_missing
can be used to delegate constant lookup to Object:

class MyObjectSystem < BasicObject
  def self.const_missing(name)
    ::Object.const_get(name)
  end
end

  BasicObject is the root of Ruby’s class hierarchy. It deliberately has just a few methods,
allowing it to be conveniently used as the basis for a number of metaprogramming techniques.
If you write code in a direct descendent of BasicObject, you will not have unqualified access
to the methods in Kernel, which normally get mixed in to Object. This example illustrates how
to invoke Kernel methods explicitly:

class SimpleBuilder < BasicObject
  def __puts_at_indent__(string)
    ::Kernel.puts " " * @indent + string
  end
  def method_missing(name, *args, &block)
    @indent ||= 0
    __puts_at_indent__("<#{name}>")
    @indent += 2
    __puts_at_indent__(args.join) unless args.empty?
    yield if ::Kernel.block_given?
    @indent -= 2
    __puts_at_indent__("</#{name}>")
  end
end

r = SimpleBuilder.new
r.person do
  r.name "Dave"
  r.address do
    r.street "123 Main"
    r.city "Pleasantville"
  end
end
produces:
&lt;person&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;
    Dave
  &lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;address&gt;
    &lt;street&gt;
      123 Main
    &lt;/street&gt;
    &lt;city&gt;
      Pleasantville
    &lt;/city&gt;
  &lt;/address&gt;
&lt;/person&gt;

<h2>Public Class Methods</h2>
<h3>new()</h3>
Not documented

<h2>Public Instance Methods</h2>
p BasicObject.instance_methods.sort
produces:
[:!, :!=, :==, :__id__, :__send__, :equal?, :instance_eval, :instance_exec, :object_id]
<h3>!</h3>
!obj → true or false

  Boolean negate.
  Returns false unless obj is false. Because it’s in BasicObject, ! is defined for all objects
in Ruby.
<h3>!= </h3>
obj != other → true or false
  
  Returns true if two objects are not-equal, otherwise false.
  Returns the opposite of BasicObject#==.
<h3>==</h3>
obj == other → true or false

  Equality — At the Object level, == returns true only if obj and other are the same object.
Typically, this method is overridden in descendant classes to provide class-specific meaning.

  Unlike ==, the equal? method should never be overridden by subclasses as it is used to
determine object identity (that is, a.equal?(b) if and only if a is the same object as b):

obj = "a"
other = obj.dup

obj == other      #=> true
obj.equal? other  #=> false
obj.equal? obj    #=> true

  The eql? method returns true if obj and other refer to the same hash key. This is used by
Hash to test members for equality. For objects of class Object, eql? is synonymous with ==.
Subclasses normally continue this tradition by aliasing eql? to their overridden == method,
but there are exceptions. Numeric types, for example, perform type conversion across ==,
but not across eql?, so:

puts (1 == 1.0).inspect                #=> true
puts (1.eql? 1.0).inspect              #=> false
puts (1.equal? 1.0).inspect            #=> false
<h3>equal?( )</h3>
equal?(other) → true or false
  Alias for BasicObject#==.

puts (1.equal? 1.0).inspect            #=> false
<h3>__id__, object_id</h3>
__id__ → integer
  Synonym for Object#object_id. Prior to Ruby 1.9.3, this was an instance method of class Object.
object_id → integer

  Returns an integer identifier for obj.

  The same number will be returned on all calls to id for a given object, and no two active
objects will share an id.

  Object#object_id is a different concept from the :name notation, which returns the symbol
id of name.

  Replaces the deprecated Object#id.
<h3>__send__, send( )</h3>
send(symbol [, args...]) → obj
__send__(symbol [, args...]) → obj
send(string [, args...]) → obj
__send__(string [, args...]) → obj

  Invokes the method identified by symbol, passing it any arguments specified. 
you can use __send__ if the name send clashes with an existing method in obj. 
When the method is identified by a string, the string is converted to a symbol.

class Klass
  def hello(*args)
    "Hello " + args.join(' ')
  end
end
k = Klass.new
k.send :hello, "gentle", "readers"   #=> "Hello gentle readers"
k.__send__ :hello, "gentle", "readers" # => "Hello gentle readers"
<h3>instance_eval( )</h3>
instance_eval(string [, filename [, lineno]] ) → obj
instance_eval {| | block } → obj

  Evaluates a string containing Ruby source code, or the given block, within the context
of the receiver (obj). In order to set the context, the variable self is set to obj
while the code is executing, giving the code access to obj’s instance variables.
In the version of instance_eval that takes a String, the optional second and third
parameters supply a filename and starting line number that are used when reporting
compilation errors.

class KlassWithSecret
  def initialize
    @secret = 99
  end
end
k = KlassWithSecret.new
k.instance_eval { @secret }   #=> 99

  When metaprogramming, instance_eval is often used to execute the methods in a block in the
context of the caller:

class Recorder < BasicObject
  attr_reader :__calls__
  def method_missing(name, *args, &block)
    @__calls__ ||= []
    @__calls__ << [ name, args ]
  end
  def record(&block)
    instance_eval(&block)
  end
end
r = Recorder.new
r.record do
  disable "safety"
  pull "control rod", dir: "out"
  run
end
p r.__calls__
produces:
[[:disable, ["safety"]], [:pull, ["control rod", {:dir=>"out"}]], [:run, []]]
<h3>instance_exec( )</h3>
instance_exec(arg...) {|var...| block } → obj

  Executes the given block within the context of the receiver (obj).
In order to set the context, the variable self is set to obj while the code is executing,
giving the code access to obj’s instance variables. Arguments are passed as block parameters.

class KlassWithSecret
  def initialize
    @secret = 99
  end
end
k = KlassWithSecret.new
k.instance_exec(5) {|x| @secret+x }   #=> 104

  Executes the block with self set to obj, passing args as parameters to the block.
  
class Dummy < BasicObject
  def initialize
    @iv = 33
  end
  def double_and_call(value, &block)
    instance_exec(value*2, &block)
  end
end
d = Dummy.new
d.double_and_call(22) do |param|
  ::Kernel::puts "Parameter = #{param}"
  ::Kernel::puts "@iv = #{@iv}"
end
produces:
Parameter = 44
@iv = 33
<h2>Private Instance Methods</h2>
<h3>method_missing( )</h3>
method_missing(symbol [, *args] ) → result

  Invoked by Ruby when obj is sent a message it cannot handle. Symbol is the symbol for the
method called, and args are any arguments that were passed to it. method_missing can be used
to implement proxies, delegators, and forwarders. It can also be used to simulate the existence
of methods in the receiver, as the example at the start of this section shows.
By default, the interpreter raises an error when this method is called. However, it is possible to
override the method to provide more dynamic behavior. If it is decided that a particular
method should not be handled, then super should be called, so that ancestors can pick up
the missing method. The example below creates a class Roman, which responds to methods
with names consisting of roman numerals, returning the corresponding integer values.

class Roman
  def roman_to_int(str)
    # ...
  end
  def method_missing(methId)
    str = methId.id2name
    roman_to_int(str)
  end
end

r = Roman.new
r.iv      #=> 4
r.xxiii   #=> 23
r.mm      #=> 2000
<h3>singleton_method_added( )</h3>
singleton_method_added(symbol)

  Invoked as a callback whenever a singleton method is added to the receiver.

module Chatty
  def Chatty.singleton_method_added(id)
    puts "Adding #{id.id2name}"
  end
  def self.one()     end
  def two()          end
  def Chatty.three() end
end

produces:

Adding singleton_method_added
Adding one
Adding three

You can add the hook to any object:

obj = "cat"
def obj.singleton_method_added(id)
  puts "Adding #{id} to #{self}"
end
def obj.speak
  puts "meow"
end

produces:

Adding singleton_method_added to cat
Adding speak to cat
<h3>singleton_method_removed( )</h3>
singleton_method_removed(symbol)

  Invoked as a callback whenever a singleton method is removed from the receiver.

module Chatty
  def Chatty.singleton_method_removed(id)
    puts "Removing #{id.id2name}"
  end
  def self.one()     end
  def two()          end
  def Chatty.three() end
  class << self
    remove_method :three
    remove_method :one
  end
end

produces:

Removing three
Removing one
<h3>singleton_method_undefined( )</h3>
singleton_method_undefined(symbol)

  Invoked as a callback whenever a singleton method is undefined in the receiver.

module Chatty
  def Chatty.singleton_method_undefined(id)
    puts "Undefining #{id.id2name}"
  end
  def Chatty.one()   end
  class << self
     undef_method(:one)
  end
end

produces:

Undefining one
